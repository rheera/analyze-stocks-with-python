# Python Project for Data Science

Part of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera. This is the final project for Course 5, _Python for Data Science, AI & Development_.

For this project, we will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Our job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
